2/9 - Attempted to get gyro sensor to work
      Robot keeps turning after it has passed the specified degrees
      Working on program where robot goes around an object when it detects one in front of it
      Next lesson: will keep trying to find a solution for above problem
      
6/9 - Found solution for gyro sensor: it was put on the wrong way
      Robot now spins around the specified degrees
      Robot now attempts to go around an object detected using the touch sensor with the help of the gyro sensor
      Made similar program to the one above but with ultrasonic sensor.
      Robot tries to go around when it detects an object 6cm in front of it
      All available sensors have now been tested
      Next lesson: more work on the gyro sensor and maybe rebuilding robot
      also maybe next lesson: getting the servo motor to work
