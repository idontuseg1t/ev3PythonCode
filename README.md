2/9 - Attempted to get gyro sensor to work. <br>
      Robot keeps turning after it has passed the specified degrees. <br>
      Working on program where robot goes around an object when it detects one in front of it. <br>
      Next lesson: will keep trying to find a solution for above problem. <br>
      
6/9 - Found solution for gyro sensor: it was put on the wrong way. <br>
      Robot now spins around the specified degrees. <br>
      Robot now attempts to go around an object detected using the touch sensor with the help of the gyro sensor. <br>
      Made similar program to the one above but with ultrasonic sensor.<br>
      Robot tries to go around when it detects an object 6cm in front of it. <br>
      All available sensors have now been tested. <br>
      Next lesson: more work on the gyro sensor and maybe rebuilding robot. <br>
      also maybe next lesson: getting the servo motor to work. <br>
