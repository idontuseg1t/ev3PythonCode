30/08      
       Started Robot, missing some pieces <br>
       Cloned git repo of demo scripts <br>
       LED, sound tested and worked <br>
       
01/09      
      Completed base robot <br>
      Touch sensor added <br>
      Colour sensor added <br>
      Able to report colour <br>

02/09    
      Attempted to get gyro sensor to work. <br>
      Robot keeps turning after it has passed the specified degrees. <br>
      Working on program where robot goes around an object when it detects one in front of it. <br>
      Next lesson: will keep trying to find a solution for above problem. <br>
      
06/09  
      Found solution for gyro sensor: it was put on the wrong way. <br>
      Robot now spins around the specified degrees. <br>
      Robot now attempts to go around an object detected using the touch sensor with the help of the gyro sensor. <br>
      Made similar program to the one above but with ultrasonic sensor.<br>
      Robot tries to go around when it detects an object 6cm in front of it. <br>
      All available sensors have now been tested. <br>
      Next lesson: more work on the gyro sensor and maybe rebuilding robot. <br>
      also maybe next lesson: getting the servo motor to work. <br>
      
08/90  
      testing gyro sensor again <br>
      beginning to make script so robot can follow a line <br>
      basic script created: followLine.py <br>
      A lot can go wrong with the script above <br>
      Improvements to be made next lesson <br>
